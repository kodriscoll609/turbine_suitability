### Authors: Kevin O'Driscoll, Ruben Heinsbroek, Arend-Jan Tissing

## Description
The objective of this research is to investigate the available area for the construction of windmills and the maximum energy potential in the province of Groningen. By executing a land use analysis with a GIS based approach, the following research question will be answered: “Which locations are most suitable for the construction of windmills in the province of Groningen?” This project applies a Weighted Sum Method (WSM) to account for the social, economical, and wind energy potential factors that contribute to suitable locations for building farms.
